## Step 2: Connect Your Nokia Phone to PC
 
Before connecting your Nokia phone to PC, make sure you have backed up your important data, such as contacts, photos, and messages. Flashing your phone will erase all your data and restore it to its original settings. Also, make sure your phone has enough battery power and is switched off.
 
Now connect your Nokia phone to PC using a USB cable. You may need to press some buttons on your phone to enter the flash mode. For example, for some Nokia models, you need to press and hold the power button and volume down button simultaneously. You can check the specific instructions for your phone model on the internet or on Mxkey Tool's website.
 
## Step 3: Launch Mxkey Tool and Select Your Phone Model
 
After connecting your phone to PC, launch Mxkey Tool from your desktop or start menu. You will see a user interface with several tabs and options. Select the "Nokia" tab and then select your phone model from the drop-down menu. You can also use the auto-detect feature to let Mxkey Tool recognize your phone automatically.
 
## Step 4: Download and Load the Flash File for Your Phone
 
The next step is to download and load the flash file for your phone. The flash file is also known as firmware or stock ROM. It contains the operating system and software of your phone. You can download the flash file for your phone from various websites on the internet. Make sure you download the correct flash file that matches your phone model and region.
 
After downloading the flash file, extract it using WinRAR or any other software. Then go back to Mxkey Tool and click on the "Flash" button. A new window will open where you can browse and load the flash file for your phone. You will see several files with different extensions, such as MCU, PPM, CNT, etc. You need to load all these files in their respective slots on Mxkey Tool.
 
## Step 5: Start Flashing Your Phone
 
After loading all the files, click on the "Flash" button again to start flashing your phone. You will see a progress bar and some messages on Mxkey Tool's window. Do not disconnect your phone or interrupt the process until it is completed. Flashing your phone may take several minutes depending on the size of the flash file and the speed of your PC.
 
When the flashing process is finished, you will see a message saying "Flashing Done" on Mxkey Tool's window. You can then disconnect your phone from PC and switch it on. Your phone will boot up with the new firmware installed.
